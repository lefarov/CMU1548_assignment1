Program 4: Solution
===================

1. SIMD speedup is `2.83x` on average, the speedup from multi-core parallelization is `7.42x`. I was running the experiments on Dual Core Intel Core i5 with 4 virtual cores. For this processor the maximum theoretical speedup is `4x` for single core and `16x` for the multi-core when ISPC is compiled for `see4` 4-wide SIMD instructions. The observed values are substantially lower because of the unbalanced workload.
2. The best case input data for this program is an array with the same repeated value, which requires a lot of steps for the convergence, i.e. `3` or `0`. This input data will result in the balanced workload as well as the smallest possible ratio of memory accesses to arithmetic operations. It should result in both: high SIMD and multi-core speedups. Due to the high runtime I didn't finish the runs and didn't obtain the exact values. Will update as soon as get new hardware.
3. The worst case scenario data input would be the highly unbalanced input with the high ratio of memory accesses. Given that we have 4-wide SIMD instructions repeating `(1, 1, 1, 3)` would do the job. Alternatively we could just use array of `1`s to get the most bandwidth limited case. For the latter I had `2.53x` speedup on average for SIMD and `2.70x` for ISPC tasks.
