Program 3, Part 1: Solution
===========================

1. I was running the experiments on Dual Core Intel Core i5 with 4 virtual cores. For this processor the maximum theoretical speedup is `4x` for single core and `16x` for the multi-core when ISPC is compiled for `see4` 4-wide SIMD instructions. I've observed the speedup of `3.30x` on average for the SIMD only case and `4.40x` for the multi-core (ISPC tasks). The observed numbers are lower then the maximum possible due to the unbalanced workload. The most problematic regions of the image are those with high gradients (borders). For this regions computation of one value of the 4-wide SIMD vector can take significantly longer then for the others, which will result in stalling ALUs. Addtionaly for the black regions of the image the ratio of memory accesses to the arithmetic operations is less optimal, this the single-core speedup is decreased to `2.86x`. However, some latency in this case can be hidden with ISPC tasks.
